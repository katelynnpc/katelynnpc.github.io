                    <p>My theatre opportunities have been amazing!</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Theatre started for me in high school where I got my first ever role as a supporting lead which helped start my love for theatre. Since then I have participated in many other high school productions as well as a bunch at a local community theater called Red Curtain Foundation for the Arts located in Marysville Washington.</p>
